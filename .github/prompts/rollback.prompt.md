Roll back a merged requirement to restore the project to its pre-merge state.

Workflow:
1. Parse required `REQ-ID` and optional base branch (default `main`).
2. Validate that the requirement exists and is in `MERGED` or `DEPLOYED` status.
3. Run `scripts/dispatch.ps1 rollback-requirement` (or `scripts/dispatch.sh rollback-requirement` on Linux/macOS) with the parsed arguments.
4. Report the reverted merge commit, restored branch/worktree, and updated status.

Constraints:
- Only requirements in MERGED or DEPLOYED status can be rolled back.
- The script will refuse to revert if newer merge commits exist after the target merge (safety check).
- This operation changes git history and manifests; do not run if arguments are missing.
- Surface script failures exactly.
